        <p>In October 2020, I participated in the uXperience | Think Privacy, a hackathon hosted by the Stratford school of interaction design and business. The hackathon primarily focused on Privacy-Conscious Design and how we, as designers, could start thinking about privacy more.</p>

        <h3><br/>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>Create a privacy-conscious product, system, or service that reduces the negative impact of the physical and mental barriers that people can face during social distancing to make them feel loved, supported, or connected.</p>  

        <h3><br/>WHAT I DID</h3>

        <p>As one of the many designers part of the team, I was involved in every stage of the project. From ideation, to research, my main responsibility was to design and prototype our app. <br/> <br/> My team and I placed 2nd in the competition and are in the talking stages of making Bondfire a real thing!</p>

            <h3><br/>Why did we do this?</h3>
            <p>Live campsites allow for a private experience with a group of friends or strangers. It’s unexpected and exciting for the user to try because it is so unpredictable.</p>

        <div class="sectionInfo">
            <p>In order to understand the struggles of many during the pandemic, we asked over 30 university students about the difficulties and barriers of social distancing. We determined that many were having difficulties connecting with people and were not satisfied with their current method of so. <br/> <br/> Over 70% of respondents mentioned them not being able to connect to others on a deeper level with current apps in the market. This inspired us to research more on relationship building and came across the idea of building a community through the power of storytelling.

            <p>Responses from the user survey inspired us to research more on the idea of relationship building and how human connections are made and developed. During our research, we came across the idea of storytelling and how it can be powerful in building relationships. <br/> <br/> Learning about how impactful and important storytelling is in our society, lead us to focus on a more specific problem: <br/> <br/> <h3> How might we build a trustworthy community with the power of storytelling? </h3>
