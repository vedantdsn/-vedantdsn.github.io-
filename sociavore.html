        <h2>Sociavore Rebrand</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div id="infoIntro">
        <p>In Summer 2020, I worked as a Product Design Intern at Sociavore, a start-up focused on helping restaurants establish an online presence and improve their online experience. /p>

        <h3><br/>WHAT I DID</h3>

        <p>As the only designer at Sociavore, I was in charge of redesigning Sociavore’s current website in order to make it more approachable and visually appealing to attract more customers to the platform. <br/> <br/> This was my biggest project with Sociavore over my internship and was successfully launched in November 2020.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="sectionInfo">
            <p>We began our process by identifying the key problems with the current Sociavore website to get a better understanding of how to approach the redesign. <br/> <br/> In order to understand the website experience from an outsider's perspective, we had Sociavore’s current customers and first-time site visitors to navigate through the website and ask for their opinion on their way.

        <div class="sectionInfo">
            <p>Find new customers who are looking to establish a digital experience for their restaurant through a website. <br/> <br/> Website’s design should work with future content updates</p>  
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p> — Website should focus on Sociavore’s Features</p>
            <p> — Website should showcase current websites hosted by Sociavore</p>
            <p> — Website's design should be simple but effective</p>

        <div class="sectionInfo">
            <p>User feedback: “Information was Confusing and overwhelming”, and “Found it difficult to navigate through the website” <br/> <br/> To tackle this problem, we revisited the Information Architecture of the website. Since our main selling points were Sociavore’s features, we focused on them first.

            <p>Fleshed out Sociavore’s core features and organized all of them into three main categories: Build, Grow, and Connect. Each category had its own set of features, all related to each other. <br/> <br/> This was done to not only make it easier for users to understand each feature but also to improve the overall navigation of the site.  </p>

        <div class="sectionInfo">
            <p>To start with the design of the pages, we first focused on polishing the home page. The home page is the first and most important user touchpoint as it is where the customer is exploring the website and deciding to sign up or not.</p>

        <div class="sectionInfo">
            <p>We went through multiple rounds of explorations of the landing and feature pages. Focusing on the landing page, we began by creating low-fidelity wireframes. Goal was to keep it simple but also aesthetically pleasing to encourage the user to stay on the website. These iterations were presented to the project manager and rest of the team.</p>

            <p>Since our main goal for the website is to attract new customers who are looking to create a website for their restaurant.</p>

        <div class="sectionInfo">
            <p>The category pages were added to act sort of like another landing page for a specific set of features. </p>

        <div class="sectionInfo">
            <p>Each category landing page allows the user to learn more about the feature themselves without having to go to each individual page. This aids in solving the problem of having overwhelming and confusing information. </p>

        <div class="sectionInfo">
            <p>Due to each feature having its own page, we were able to go more in depth about each feature and how it works. We made sure the information was easy to digest by having each card feature three points and a visual.</p>
